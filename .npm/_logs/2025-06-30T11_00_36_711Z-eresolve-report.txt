# npm resolution error report

While resolving: learn-coding-with-rugby@0.0.0
Found: vite@7.0.0
node_modules/vite
  dev vite@"^7.0.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer vite@"^3.1.0 || ^4.0.0 || ^5.0.0 || ^6.0.0" from vite-plugin-pwa@1.0.0
node_modules/vite-plugin-pwa
  vite-plugin-pwa@"*" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
